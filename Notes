Tutorial: Intro to Programming 

Variable names are ideally short and descriptive. They also need to satisfy several requirements:

They can't have spaces (e.g., test var is not allowed)
They can only include letters, numbers, and underscores (e.g., test_var! is not allowed)
They have to start with a letter or underscore (e.g., 1_var is not allowed)
